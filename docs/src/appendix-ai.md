# Appendix: For AI Agents

The code-oriented map for LLM-powered tooling lives in `docs/AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`. It details module ownership, data flows, and extensibility notes. Consult it when automating refactors or adding routes so changes line up with the established surfaces in `src/app.rs` and friends.
